is Sustainable Graphic Design? In Flourishing, John Ehrenfeld writes that “The key to doing something about sustainability is that you first have to say what it is that you want to sustain.” So, to define sustainable graphic design then we first must define what it is we are sustaining. Sustainable graphic design is design in service of what you want to sustain. Ehrenfeld wants to sustain “that all humans and other life should flourish.” Bruce Mau described \"Massive Change\" similarly: “Our project is the welfare of all life.” Sustainable graphic design is then perhaps best defined as “graphic design in support of all life flourishing.” Sustainable Graphic Design is thus very different than status quo design. \"All life flourishing\" is not the traditional goal of business, culture, and design. Sustainable graphic design doesn’t solely rely on better materials or more socially conscious manufacturing. If sustainable graphic design is different than regular design, it requires different ways of thinking and making. Sustainable graphic design should also potentially carry with it different styles/aesthetics/outcomes. (All design is ideological, how some looks reflects what ideologies it promotes, etc.)\n"},"contents":null,"share_link":null,"follower_count":31,"can_index":true,"owner_type":"User","owner_id":7771,"owner_slug":"kristian-bjornard","nsfw?":false,"state":"available","user":{"id":7771,"created_at":"2015-07-20T04:13:00.109Z","slug":"kristian-bjornard","username":"Kristian Bjornard","first_name":"Kristian","last_name":"Bjornard","full_name":"Kristian Bjornard","avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/fb2c5baf37b71031494bf962c9589174.png?d=blank&r=r&s=150","avatar_image":{"thumb":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/fb2c5baf37b71031494bf962c9589174.png?d=blank&r=r&s=40","display":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/fb2c5baf37b71031494bf962c9589174.png?d=blank&r=r&s=150"},"channel_count":164,"following_count":93,"profile_id":31476,"follower_count":57,"initials":"KB","can_index":true,"metadata":{"description":null},"is_premium":true,"is_exceeding_private_connections_limit":false,"is_confirmed":true,"is_pending_reconfirmation":false,"is_pending_confirmation":false,"badge":"premium","base_class":"User","class":"User"},"group":null,"base_class":"Channel","class":"Channel","position":2,"selected":false,"connection_id":8740204,"connected_at":"2019-12-11T14:52:38.673Z","connected_by_user_id":11309,"connected_by_username":"devin halladay","connected_by_user_slug":"devin-halladay"},{"id":228600,"title":"§ SGD","created_at":"2018-08-16T17:24:09.554Z","updated_at":"2020-03-14T07:38:34.483Z","added_to_at":"2020-03-12T18:18:24.559Z","published":true,"open":false,"collaboration":false,"collaborator_count":0,"slug":"sgd","length":402,"kind":"default","status":"closed","user_id":7771,"metadata":{"description":"Sustainable Graphic Design.

The world is quickly being replaced by a technical model of itself. I don't go outside to check the weather anymore, I check my phone. I don't go into the forest anymore, I visit a well-maintained and socially engineered park. The world is losing its vital materialism, and the consequences of this are far-reaching: there are implications in all social, political, economic, environmental, and other spheres. Denying the vitality and agency of certain things and non-things in the world sets a dangerous precedent that has for ages been used as the organizational ideology for violent atrocities committed against minorities, nations, the earth, and the things we've produced. I understand now why Nietzsche wrote something along the lines of \"I mistrust all systematizers and avoid them. The will to a system is a lack of integrity.\" (If you wish to know the exact source, you can look it up).</p><p>If we can't get rid of models and representation (I know we can't, and I know intuitively that we shouldn't): I want us to redefine the primitive concepts of models and representations. What does it really mean to represent something? How do we judge fidelity and authenticity and value? How do we retain a link between our artificial systems and the world's vital materialism? How do we augment the world transparently and organically rather than abstracting and erasing it through scientific canonicalization?</p><p>Lots of things need to change for this augmentation to happen, but here are a few: - We need to redefine what truth means in terms of human value systems — what does it mean to us, why do we search for it, do we really need all of it? - We need to find ways to bring our artificial systems and natural systems closer together. Hybrid systems are the only way forward. - We need to redefine at least the dominant Western ontology and restructure our way of categorizing the world into one that flattens hierarchy and recognizes intrinsic agency of matter.</p><p>This is a call for an ontology of presence, or a vital ontology. A new world of universal agency. An animated world.</p><p>But no revolution is coming. Not suddenly, anyways — more softly and spiritually, creeping in as culture evolves generation to generation. What we need is new generations of humans to adopt these ideas. To become closer to the earth and the human and the real. We need to bring vital materialism to social living and world building.</p><p>Vital materialism for me leads to dynamic ontologies that assume and defend the agency of all matter and non-matter (like ideas). Vital materialism also brings with it, for me, the essential idea that all things and non-things are connected. I believe that a vital materialism underlies all artifacts, systems, beings, activities, ideas, and spirits (by spirit here I mean something like history). Vitality is derived from being a contributing part of a dynamic system that enables the emergence and entropic decay of its parts. I know this is a broad definition, but it means that most things and beings have vital materialism and should be treated as such. This is like animism without the mysticism (forgive me if I misinterpret animism, I'm not extremely familiar).</p><p>The implications of evolving our social systems to adopt a vital materialist ontology and ideology are wide ranging and too complex for this single post, but I will say this much more: to create a more natural, engaged, real, joyful, and prosperous world, we need a revolution in materialism itself. Vital materialism yields vital politics, vital economics, a vital social, vital labor, vital study, vital living.</p>","description_html":"","visibility":"private","content":"I want access to the real.

The world is losing its vital materialism, and the consequences of this are far-reaching: there are implications in all social, political, economic, environmental, and other spheres. Denying the vitality and agency of certain things and non-things in the world sets a dangerous precedent that has for ages been used as the organizational ideology for violent atrocities committed against minorities, nations, the earth, and the things we've produced. I understand now why Nietzsche wrote something along the lines of \"I mistrust all systematizers and avoid them. The will to a system is a lack of integrity.\" (If you wish to know the exact source, you can look it up).\n\nIf we can't get rid of models and representation (I know we can't, and I know intuitively that we shouldn't): I want us to redefine the primitive concepts of models and representations. What does it really mean to represent something? How do we judge fidelity and authenticity and value? How do we retain a link between our artificial systems and the world's vital materialism? How do we augment the world transparently and organically rather than abstracting and erasing it through scientific canonicalization?\n\nLots of things need to change for this augmentation to happen, but here are a few: - We need to redefine what truth means in terms of human value systems — what does it mean to us, why do we search for it, do we really need all of it? - We need to find ways to bring our artificial systems and natural systems closer together. Hybrid systems are the only way forward. - We need to redefine at least the dominant Western ontology and restructure our way of categorizing the world into one that flattens hierarchy and recognizes intrinsic agency of matter.\n\nThis is a call for an ontology of presence, or a vital ontology. A new world of universal agency. An animated world.\n\nBut no revolution is coming. Not suddenly, anyways — more softly and spiritually, creeping in as culture evolves generation to generation. What we need is new generations of humans to adopt these ideas. To become closer to the earth and the human and the real. We need to bring vital materialism to social living and world building.\n\nVital materialism for me leads to dynamic ontologies that assume and defend the agency of all matter and non-matter (like ideas). Vital materialism also brings with it, for me, the essential idea that all things and non-things are connected. I believe that a vital materialism underlies all artifacts, systems, beings, activities, ideas, and spirits (by spirit here I mean something like history). Vitality is derived from being a contributing part of a dynamic system that enables the emergence and entropic decay of its parts. I know this is a broad definition, but it means that most things and beings have vital materialism and should be treated as such. This is like animism without the mysticism (forgive me if I misinterpret animism, I'm not extremely familiar).\n\nThe implications of evolving our social systems to adopt a vital materialist ontology and ideology are wide ranging and too complex for this single post, but I will say this much more: to create a more natural, engaged, real, joyful, and prosperous world, we need a revolution in materialism itself. Vital materialism yields vital politics, vital economics, a vital social, vital labor, vital study, vital living.","description":"","source":null,"image":null,"embed":null,"attachment":null,"metadata":null,"base_class":"Block","class":"Text","user":{"id":11309,"created_at":"2016-08-05T02:32:15.541Z","slug":"devin-halladay","username":"devin halladay","first_name":"devin","last_name":"halladay","full_name":"devin halladay","avatar":"https://arena-avatars.s3.amazonaws.com/11309/small_9d2500c5bd1825401dcd9d165fd96564.png?1573182030","avatar_image":{"thumb":"https://arena-avatars.s3.amazonaws.com/11309/small_9d2500c5bd1825401dcd9d165fd96564.png?1573182030","display":"https://arena-avatars.s3.amazonaws.com/11309/medium_9d2500c5bd1825401dcd9d165fd96564.png?1573182030"},"channel_count":160,"following_count":339,"profile_id":51377,"follower_count":113,"initials":"dh","can_index":true,"metadata":{"description":null},"is_premium":true,"is_exceeding_private_connections_limit":false,"is_confirmed":true,"is_pending_reconfirmation":false,"is_pending_confirmation":false,"badge":"investor","base_class":"User","class":"User"},"position":3,"selected":false,"connection_id":7784551,"connected_at":"2019-10-03T03:42:20.805Z","connected_by_user_id":11309,"connected_by_username":"devin halladay","connected_by_user_slug":"devin-halladay"},{"id":5161275,"title":"","updated_at":"2019-10-03T03:41:35.712Z","created_at":"2019-10-03T03:41:34.639Z","state":"available","comment_count":0,"generated_title":"Untitled","content_html":"<p>&lt;blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"&gt;I need an in-depth technical deconstruction of what it would take to suspend a virtual point 2cm above my left wrist at all times, for all eternity, no matter where i am, no matter how i move, no matter if I lose my hand/arm&lt;/p&gt;— _.;-* (@edouerd) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/edouerd/status/1138532623461076992\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://twitter.com/edouerd/status/1138532623461076992</a></p><p>Our constructs on top of reality, our interfaces — religions, governments, stock markets, software, sciences, mathematics — are mediations between us and the Real.

When the graph is fully connected — every misfit affects every other misfit — solutions are nearly unobtainable.\n\n\n(https://medium.com/@hyponymous/notes-on-notes-on-the-synthesis-of-form-5327aa6ff6a1)","description":"","source":null,"image":null,"embed":null,"attachment":null,"metadata":null,"base_class":"Block","class":"Text","user":{"id":11309,"created_at":"2016-08-05T02:32:15.541Z","slug":"devin-halladay","username":"devin halladay","first_name":"devin","last_name":"halladay","full_name":"devin halladay","avatar":"https://arena-avatars.s3.amazonaws.com/11309/small_9d2500c5bd1825401dcd9d165fd96564.png?1573182030","avatar_image":{"thumb":"https://arena-avatars.s3.amazonaws.com/11309/small_9d2500c5bd1825401dcd9d165fd96564.png?1573182030","display":"https://arena-avatars.s3.amazonaws.com/11309/medium_9d2500c5bd1825401dcd9d165fd96564.png?1573182030"},"channel_count":160,"following_count":339,"profile_id":51377,"follower_count":113,"initials":"dh","can_index":true,"metadata":{"description":null},"is_premium":true,"is_exceeding_private_connections_limit":false,"is_confirmed":true,"is_pending_reconfirmation":false,"is_pending_confirmation":false,"badge":"investor","base_class":"User","class":"User"},"position":4,"selected":false,"connection_id":2056286,"connected_at":"2018-01-29T19:34:31.399Z","connected_by_user_id":11309,"connected_by_username":"devin halladay","connected_by_user_slug":"devin-halladay"},{"id":1667963,"title":"","updated_at":"2018-01-29T19:27:21.230Z","created_at":"2018-01-29T19:25:55.037Z","state":"available","comment_count":0,"generated_title":"Untitled","content_html":"<p>unselfconscious process vs selfconscious process</p><p>postrational design should lean more toward selfconscious processes, never taking history and tradition as givens and always taking moments to question the validity and use of these things</p>","description_html":"","visibility":"public","content":"unselfconscious process vs selfconscious process\n\npostrational design should lean more toward selfconscious processes, never taking history and tradition as givens and always taking moments to question the validity and use of these things","description":"","source":null,"image":null,"embed":null,"attachment":null,"metadata":null,"base_class":"Block","class":"Text","user":{"id":11309,"created_at":"2016-08-05T02:32:15.541Z","slug":"devin-halladay","username":"devin halladay","first_name":"devin","last_name":"halladay","full_name":"devin halladay","avatar":"https://arena-avatars.s3.amazonaws.com/11309/small_9d2500c5bd1825401dcd9d165fd96564.png?1573182030","avatar_image":{"thumb":"https://arena-avatars.s3.amazonaws.com/11309/small_9d2500c5bd1825401dcd9d165fd96564.png?1573182030","display":"https://arena-avatars.s3.amazonaws.com/11309/medium_9d2500c5bd1825401dcd9d165fd96564.png?1573182030"},"channel_count":160,"following_count":339,"profile_id":51377,"follower_count":113,"initials":"dh","can_index":true,"metadata":{"description":null},"is_premium":true,"is_exceeding_private_connections_limit":false,"is_confirmed":true,"is_pending_reconfirmation":false,"is_pending_confirmation":false,"badge":"investor","base_class":"User","class":"User"},"position":3,"selected":false,"connection_id":2056233,"connected_at":"2018-01-29T19:25:55.055Z","connected_by_user_id":11309,"connected_by_username":"devin halladay","connected_by_user_slug":"devin-halladay"},{"id":1667952,"title":"","updated_at":"2018-01-29T19:23:43.352Z","created_at":"2018-01-29T19:23:43.184Z","state":"available","comment_count":0,"generated_title":"Untitled","content_html":"<p>“While … a great deal of what is generally understood to be logic is concerned with deduction, logic… refers to something far more general.
